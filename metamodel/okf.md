# OKF Profile

## Purpose

The `/specs` knowledge base must be maintained in conformance with the Object Knowledge Foundation (OKF) model adopted by this repository.

This file defines the repository-level compliance rules. The other files in `method/metamodel/` define the concrete concept types, folder structure, and expected anatomy used to apply those rules.

## Compliance rules

1. Represent durable knowledge as explicit typed concepts rather than as undifferentiated documents.
2. Give independently meaningful modeled concepts independent semantic identity.
3. Use semantic identifiers and names; do not invent sequential identifiers such as `UC-001` unless required by an external system.
4. Represent relationships between concepts explicitly rather than relying on prose location or file co-location to imply them.
5. Keep concept type, identity, meaning, and relationships stable when reorganizing files.
6. Store each independently meaningful modeled object in its own file unless the meta-model explicitly defines a collection form.
7. Use the folder and concept structure defined by `structure.md`, `requirements.md`, `architecture.md`, and `design.md`.
8. Do not create new concept types casually. First determine whether the knowledge is an instance, relationship, property, or specialization of an existing concept.
9. If a concept is required but is not part of the adopted OKF model, identify it explicitly as an **extension** in the meta-model before using it throughout `/specs`.
10. Do not redefine an OKF concept locally with incompatible semantics. Extend it explicitly when additional project semantics are required.

## Editing rule

Before creating or editing anything under `/specs`, an agent must identify the knowledge type being changed and apply the corresponding meta-model definition.

If the correct representation is unclear, preserve the knowledge without inventing a competing structure and raise the ambiguity for resolution.

## Verification

OKF compliance includes checking that:

- specification objects use recognized concept types;
- independently meaningful objects have stable semantic identities;
- files are placed according to the meta-model;
- relationships are explicit and resolvable;
- no duplicate competing representation of the same concept has been introduced;
- extensions are declared as extensions;
- no specification structure silently contradicts the adopted OKF profile;
- files conform to the frontmatter rules in §9 (every non-reserved `.md` file has a parseable frontmatter block with a non-empty, correctly-cased `type`; reserved filenames follow the §9.3 structure when present);
- recommended fields (§9.4) are populated where the information is readily available, even though their absence alone does not make a file non-conformant;
- for each capability, whether a workflow, more than one differentiated role, or a cross-entity/derived business rule was actually considered — and either represented as its own concept file or explicitly noted in the capability as not applicable to this business (per the Depth signal in `requirements.md` and the modeling-complexity rule in `workflow/rules/specification-review.md`). A capability with only single-entity, single-role, single-field-validation content and no note that broader complexity was considered and ruled out should be treated as unverified, not assumed complete.

## §9 Frontmatter

This repository's profile is an application of the Open Knowledge Format (OKF v0.1,
`https://okf.md/spec/`). §9.1–§9.3 restate that upstream specification's required and
reserved-file rules; §9.4 adds the recommended fields upstream OKF defines but leaves
optional, which this repository asks concept files to populate; §9.5 states this
repository's additional, stricter conventions layered on top of the permissive upstream
spec (these do not contradict OKF — OKF allows a profile to add stricter conventions,
provided unknown/absent fields are still tolerated by consumers).

### §9.1 Concept files

Every Markdown file under `/specs`, other than `index.md` and `log.md` (see §9.3), is a concept file and must open with a YAML frontmatter block:

```markdown
---
type: <concept-type>
---
```

Per upstream OKF: "OKF requires exactly one thing of every concept: a `type` field."

### §9.2 Type value

The frontmatter `type` field must be present and non-empty. Use the concept type defined by `structure.md`, `requirements.md`, `architecture.md`, or `design.md` that the file represents, in lowercase-kebab-case, e.g. `domain`, `capability`, `entity`, `use-case`, `workflow`, `business-rule`, `role`, `page`, `api-contract`, `integration`, `architecture`. Declare project-specific types as extensions per the editing rule above rather than inventing untyped files.

Upstream OKF treats `type` as "a short string identifying the concept's type" without mandating a casing convention; the lowercase-kebab-case requirement is this repository's own stricter convention (see §9.5).

### §9.3 index.md and log.md

`index.md` and `log.md` are OKF's reserved filenames. They are structural, not concepts, and are exempt from §9.1/§9.2:

- `index.md` must not carry a populated frontmatter block (an empty `---\n---` block is permitted). Per upstream OKF, an `index.md` "lists the directory's contents for progressive disclosure" — one or more headed sections grouping concepts, with entries that should include the linked concept's `description`. It may appear in any directory; producers may generate it, and consumers may synthesize one on the fly when absent.
- `log.md` must not carry a frontmatter block at all. Per upstream OKF, a `log.md` "may appear at any level of the hierarchy to record the change history at that scope": a flat list of prose entries grouped by date, most recent first, with date headings in ISO 8601 `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- Neither file is required to exist. Their absence does not make a directory non-conformant.

### §9.4 Recommended fields

Upstream OKF recommends these additional frontmatter fields on concept files, in priority order. They are optional — a concept file lacking them is still conformant — but should be populated when the information is readily known, since other tooling (index generation, search, previews) is defined against them:

- `title` — human-readable name; if omitted, consumers may derive one from the filename.
- `description` — a single sentence summarizing the concept; used by `index.md` entries, search snippets, and previews.
- `tags` — a YAML list of short strings for cross-cutting categorization.
- `timestamp` — ISO 8601 datetime of the last significant change to the concept.
- `resource` — a URI uniquely identifying the asset the concept describes, when the concept describes a concrete asset rather than an abstract idea; normally absent for business/design concepts in this repository.

Example:

```markdown
---
type: role
title: Consultant Administrator
description: Maintains staff, client, project, and assignment records for the application.
tags: [business, role]
---
```

### §9.5 This repository's additional conventions

These go beyond what upstream OKF requires, and exist to keep `/specs` navigable across many concept files in one repository. They must not be treated as loosening or overriding the upstream rules above:

- `type` values must be lowercase-kebab-case, drawn from `structure.md`/`requirements.md`/`architecture.md`/`design.md` (§9.2).
- One independently meaningful modeled object per file (see the Compliance rules above), rather than upstream OKF's silence on file granularity.
